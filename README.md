# Overview

Pomotask is a console app that helps users break milestone projects into tasks. It also assist them to have a deep work on their selected task through the pomodoro technique. Pomodoro consists of a sequence of deep work sessions followed by short breaks. The app allows users to add a task, remove a task, update a task, and start a pomodoro session on a particular task.

# Learning Acquisition

The purpose of this project is to learn the C++ programming language. I have learned about the syntax of C++ and how to use it to create a console application. I have also learned how to modularize my code with classes and functions. I have also covered on how to output and input data to add from console. Finally, the app is a way to show my understanding of C++ to have a CRUD application. As a bonus, I learned about the basic of file manipulation to save and load tasks from a file.

# Future Work

- The UI of the software
- Converting it into an executable (.exe) software
- Allow for adding multiple attachements to the task such as full description, documents
